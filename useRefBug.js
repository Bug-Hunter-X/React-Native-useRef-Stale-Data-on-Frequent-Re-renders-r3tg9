This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a functional component that is being re-rendered frequently.  The problem stems from the fact that the ref's value is not updated immediately after the component's re-render.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and race conditions if the ref is used to access or manipulate DOM elements or other state that changes rapidly.  The error often manifests as stale data or an inability to interact with the element correctly.
